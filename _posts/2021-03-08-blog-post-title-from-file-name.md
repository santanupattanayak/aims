## Understanding Attention

1. Traditional sequence models like RNNs and LSTMs suffer from loss of memory as sequences get longer.
2. This can be explained mathematically how RNNs typically wok. The state $`x_t`$ at time $`t`$ updates the hidden state $h_{t}$ from  $`x_t`$ and $h_{t-1}$ using the  recurrence  $`h_t`$ = $`\sigma(`$ $`W_{hh}`$$`h_{t-1}`$  + $`W_{xh}`$$`h_{t-1})`$ where the sigmoid is aplied elementwise on the linear transform.

3. Now for the RNN to learn useful correlation between words/subtokens at positions $`t`$ and $`t-k`$ esentially at distance $`k`$ during backpropagation the Jacobian of $`h_t`$ wrt to  $`h_{t-k}`$ i.e.  $`\nabla_{h_{t-k}} h_t`$ should have significant value.

4. Let's probe $`\nabla_{h_{t-k}} h_t`$ . It can be expressed by chain rule as   $`\prod_{j=t:t-k-1}\nabla_{h_{j-1}} h_j`$

5. Now $`\nabla_{h_{j-1}} h_j = \sigma^{'}(.)W_{hh}`$ where $`\sigma^{'}(t)`$ is a diagonal matrix housing the  derivatives for each dimension of hidden variable $`h_t`$. To make it more clear if we represent  $`\tilde{h_{t}}=`$ $`\begin{bmatrix}\tilde{h_{t}^{0}} & .. & \tilde{h_{t}^{i}} & ..\end{bmatrix}^{T} =`$   $`W_{hh}`$$`h_{t-1}`$  + $`W_{xh}`$$`h_{t-1}`$  then $`\sigma^{'}(t)`$ in its $`i`$th diagonal entry would house $`\frac{\partial h_{t}^{(i)}}{\partial \tilde{h_{t}^{(i)}}}`$


    
Enter attention: a method that allows the model to assign relevance weights to different parts of an input when producing an output.
Think of it like reading a novel and highlighting the lines that resonate with you. The attention mechanism does something similarâ€”it dynamically weighs words, pixels, or tokens based on their contextual importance.
This is a sample blog post. You can talk about all sorts of fun things here.
